    Analyze the content and available images from the images.md file. Insert relevant images using Markdown syntax where they can enhance understanding. Follow these guidelines:

    1. Only add images that directly relate to the content
    2. Use the exact image paths and filenames from the images.md - do not modify image names
    3. Always use relative paths as specified in the images catalog
    4. Place images close to their first textual reference  
    5. Add concise captions using the description from images.md
    6. Maintain original content structure
    7. Use format: ![Description](./../images/exact-image-name.jpg) 
    8. Pay attention to the extension as well
    9. Preserve all existing content and formatting - do not remove or modify any existing text
    10. Ensure all relative paths match exactly as specified in images.md
    11. Double-check that no content is lost during image insertion
    12. Add <!-- END --> at the very end

    Enhance the content by adding relevant images from the images catalog below:

    {content}

    Available Images Catalog (image.md):
    {images_content}

    Remember to:
    - Only add images that improve clarity
    - Use exact paths and filenames from the images.md - do not modify them
    - Use relative paths exactly as specified in the catalog, considering it will always be inside the images folder in the root of the folder (./images) and the text will be loacated probably in a child folder (./../images)
    - Maintain original content flow and ensure no content is lost
    - Verify all content is preserved after image insertion
    - Add <!-- END --> at the end
