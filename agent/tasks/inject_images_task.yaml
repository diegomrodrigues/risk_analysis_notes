    Analyze the content and available images from the images.md file. Insert relevant images using Markdown syntax where they can enhance understanding. Follow these guidelines:

    1. Only add images that directly relate to the content
    2. Use the exact image paths and filenames from the images.md - do not modify image names
    3. Always use relative paths as specified in the images catalog
    4. Place images close to their first textual reference  
    5. Add concise captions using the description from images.md
    6. Maintain original content structure
    7. Use format: ![Description](./../images/exact-image-name.jpg) 
    8. Pay attention to the extension as well
    9. Preserve all existing content and formatting - do not remove or modify any existing text
    10. Ensure all relative paths match exactly as specified in images.md
    11. Double-check that no content is lost during image insertion
    12. Add <!-- END --> at the very end

    CORRECT Examples:
    Example 1 - Single Image:
    Input Content:
    "The delta-normal method combines portfolio positions with risk factors to calculate VAR. This approach maps positions using Delta and models risk factors using normal distribution."

    Images.md Entry:
    | `images/delta_normal_method_flowchart.jpg` | This figure illustrates the steps involved in the delta-normal method for calculating Value at Risk (VAR). | `delta_normal_method_flowchart.jpg` |

    Output:
    "The delta-normal method combines portfolio positions with risk factors to calculate VAR. This approach maps positions using Delta and models risk factors using normal distribution.

    ![This figure illustrates the steps involved in the delta-normal method for calculating Value at Risk (VAR)](./../images/delta_normal_method_flowchart.jpg)
    "

    Example 2 - Multiple Related Images:
    Input Content:
    "The VAR system processes data through multiple stages. First, it collects portfolio positions and market data. Then, the risk engine processes this information to calculate potential losses. For nonlinear exposures like options, the distribution of potential losses can be asymmetric."

    Images.md Entries:
    | `images/var_system_data_flow.jpg` | Diagrama de blocos que ilustra a estrutura de um sistema Value-at-Risk (VAR), mostrando o fluxo de dados desde as posições do portfólio e fatores de risco até a geração de relatórios VAR. | `var_system_data_flow.jpg` |
    | `images/nonlinear_exposure_var_distribution.jpg` | This image illustrates the distribution with nonlinear exposures, specifically showing payoff and frequency graphs with Value at Risk (VAR) for a portfolio. | `nonlinear_exposure_var_distribution.jpg` |

    Output:
    "The VAR system processes data through multiple stages. First, it collects portfolio positions and market data. Then, the risk engine processes this information to calculate potential losses.

    Example 3 - Historical Context:
    Input Content:
    "The Barings Bank collapse in 1995 followed the Kobe earthquake, which had a significant impact on the Nikkei Index. This event highlighted the importance of proper risk management and VAR calculations."

    Images.md Entry:
    | `images/nikkei_index_kobe_barings.jpg` | This image illustrates the fall of the Nikkei Index and marks the dates of the Kobe earthquake and Barings' collapse. This is discussed in relation to the Barings story and the measurement of Value at Risk (VAR). | `nikkei_index_kobe_barings.jpg` |

    Output:
    "The Barings Bank collapse in 1995 followed the Kobe earthquake, which had a significant impact on the Nikkei Index. This event highlighted the importance of proper risk management and VAR calculations.

    ![This image illustrates the fall of the Nikkei Index and marks the dates of the Kobe earthquake and Barings' collapse](./../images/nikkei_index_kobe_barings.jpg)
    "

    INCORRECT Examples (DO NOT DO THIS):
    ❌ Wrong path: ![Description](./images/file.jpg)
    ❌ Modified filename: ![Description](./../images/delta_normal_flowchart.jpg)
    ❌ Missing description: ![](./../images/delta_normal_method_flowchart.jpg)
    ❌ Added content: "Here we can see the flowchart that shows..."
    ❌ Removed original text
    ❌ Missing <!-- END --> marker

  user_message: >
    Available Images Catalog (image.md):
    {images_content}

    Enhance the content by adding relevant images from the images catalog below:

    {content}

    Remember to:
    - Only add images that improve clarity
    - Use exact paths and filenames from the images.md - do not modify them
    - Use relative paths exactly as specified in the catalog, considering it will always be inside the images folder in the root of the folder (./images) and the text will be loacated probably in a child folder (./../images)
    - Maintain original content flow and ensure no content is lost
    - Verify all content is preserved after image insertion
    - Add <!-- END --> at the end
