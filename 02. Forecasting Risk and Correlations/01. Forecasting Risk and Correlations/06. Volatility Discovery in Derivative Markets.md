### Introdu√ß√£o
This chapter focuses on forecasting variation in risk and correlations within financial markets, building upon the previous discussions regarding volatility models and correlation dynamics [^1]. As mentioned earlier [^1, 3], financial markets exhibit time-varying volatility, which necessitates the use of models capable of capturing these fluctuations for effective risk management. This section will explore how **price discovery** in derivatives markets, particularly options, provides valuable information about market prices, including volatility, and offers insights into the market's expectation of future volatility [^19]. Implied Volatility (ISD) is a powerful metric derived from option prices and, as we'll see, can outperform traditional models based solely on historical data [^19].

### Conceitos Fundamentais

#### 9.4 Using Options Data
While measures like VaR are only as effective as the forecasts of risk and correlations they use, relying solely on historical data may not provide the best predictions for future risks [^19]. This limitation stems from historical data's inability to swiftly incorporate regime shifts and other market dynamic alterations [^19]. In situations where regulations or conditions change, those models based purely on historical data would require significant revisions to incorporate the updated market conditions. This creates lags when attempting to quantify VaR. As such, utilizing forecasts implied within options data can prove advantageous [^19].

9.  4.  1.  Implied Volatilities

A pivotal function of derivative markets is **price discovery**, the process where markets disseminate information about market-clearing prices [^19]. As such, derivatives supply information about market clearing prices, including **volatility discovery**, which can often be difficult to model or obtain [^19]. Options, for instance, are assets whose prices depend on several factors, including the underlying asset's volatility [^19]. With all other factors observable, the volatility can be extracted by equating an option's market price with its theoretical (model) price [^19]. This process provides the **implied volatility**, alternatively referred to as the **implied standard deviation (ISD)** [^19].

**Definition:**
Implied volatility, denoted as $\sigma_{ISD}$, is the volatility value that, when input into an option pricing model (e.g., Black-Scholes), results in the model price matching the observed market price of the option. It is a forward-looking measure of volatility derived from option prices.

**Teorema 1** (Inverting Option Pricing Models): *The implied volatility can be obtained by inverting an option pricing formula. Find $\sigma_{ISD}$ such that*

$$C_{market} = f(\sigma_{ISD})$$

*where $C_{market}$ is the market price of the option and $f$ is the option pricing function (e.g., Black-Scholes).*

The root finding process or other numerical technique needs to be used to "back out" the implied volatility if all else is known.

*Proof strategy:* In a complete and arbitrage-free market, the price of an option is uniquely determined by its underlying asset price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free rate, and volatility. By observing the market price of an option and knowing all other inputs, we can solve for the implied volatility that satisfies the equation.

This method can infer a term structure of ISDs, plotting the ISD against the maturity of the associated option each day [^19]. This plot is helpful when the maturities for available options are inconsistent. Noteworthy is that $\sigma_{ISD}$ corresponds to the average volatility over the option's lifetime, not instantaneous, overnight volatility [^19]. Limited quotes for longer-term options may necessitate extrapolating the volatility surface for near-term data [^19]. This "near-term" data would then provide additional information for the GARCH, EWMA, and other models that are used to forecast future volatility.

*Proof:*

I. Option Pricing Models:
*   Option pricing models, such as the Black-Scholes model, provide a theoretical value for an option based on several inputs, including the underlying asset price ($S_0$), strike price ($K$), time to maturity ($T$), risk-free interest rate ($r$), and volatility ($\sigma$).

*   The general form of an option pricing model can be represented as:

$C = f(S_0, K, T, r, \sigma)$
*   where $C$ is the theoretical price of the option, and $f$ is the option pricing function.

II. Market Price of the Option:
The market price of an option ($C_{market}$) is the price at which the option is trading in the market. This price reflects the collective expectations and risk preferences of market participants.

III. Implied Volatility (ISD):
*   The implied volatility is the value of $\sigma$ that equates the theoretical price of the option with its market price.
*   Mathematically, the implied volatility is the solution to the equation:
$C_{market} = f(S_0, K, T, r, \sigma_{ISD})$

To solve for $\sigma_{ISD}$, one needs to numerically solve the non-linear equation above. Several numerical methods can be used:
i) Newton-Raphson method:
The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative root-finding algorithm that refines an initial estimate of $\sigma_{ISD}$ until the difference between the model price and the market price is sufficiently small. The iterative formula is:

$$\sigma_{i+1} = \sigma_i - \frac{f(\sigma_i) - C_{market}}{f'(\sigma_i)}$$
where:

*   $\sigma_{i+1}$ is the updated estimate of the implied volatility

*   $\sigma_i$ is the current estimate of the implied volatility

*   $f(\sigma_i)$ is the model price (e.g., Black-Scholes price) with $\sigma_i$

*   $f'(\sigma_i)$ is the derivative of the model price with respect to volatility (Vega)

*   $C_{market}$ is the market price of the option
This process is iterated until a desired level of accuracy is achieved.

ii) Bisection Method
The Bisection method involves repeatedly halving the interval between two initial guesses ($\sigma_{lower}$ and $\sigma_{upper}$) that bracket the true implied volatility. This process continues until the interval becomes sufficiently small or the function value at the midpoint is close to zero. The bisection method provides the most accurate answer.

*   Initialize an interval $[\sigma_{lower}, \sigma_{upper}]$ such that $f(\sigma_{lower}) < C_{market} < f(\sigma_{upper})$
Repeat until $|\sigma_{upper} - \sigma_{lower}| < \epsilon$ (a predefined tolerance)
    *   Calculate the midpoint: $\sigma_{mid} = \frac{\sigma_{lower} + \sigma_{upper}}{2}$
    *   Evaluate $f(\sigma_{mid})$:
        *   If $f(\sigma_{mid}) < C_{market}$, set $\sigma_{lower} = \sigma_{mid}$
        *   Else set $\sigma_{upper} = \sigma_{mid}$
*   The implied volatility is then approximated by $\sigma_{mid}$

For instance, suppose we are given:
$C_{market} = \$10
$K = \$100
$S_0 = \$100
$r = 0.05$
$T = 1$
with those initial values for $S$, $K$, $r$, and $T$, an initial estimate of volatility of .01 (for example) can then be increased until the calculated Black-Scholes equation roughly matches the market price of $C_{market} = \$10. If done manually, this would be an exercise in futility since the relationship between the theoretical option price and its volatility parameter is nonlinear, but is easily calculated with a code library that automates this process.

These numerical algorithms enable the extraction of market-implied volatility from option prices, proving the practical value of market observations.
VII. Conclusion:
Implied volatility is a crucial parameter for understanding market expectations, as it is directly derived from market prices and reflects the collective wisdom of market participants. $\blacksquare$

Implied correlations may also be gleaned from triplets of options on three similar assets or quanto options involving two random variables [^19].

> This Python code uses the Newton-Raphson method to find the implied volatility. It defines the Black-Scholes formula and a function to find the implied volatility by calculating the difference between the Black-Scholes model price and the market price (C\_market). The script then outputs the implied volatility and verifies the result by calculating the Black-Scholes price with the implied volatility, demonstrating that the calculated price closely matches the given market price.

9.  4.  2.  ISDs as Risk Forecasts
If option markets exhibit efficiency, the ISD should provide the optimal forecast of future volatility [^20]. This efficiency stems from the fact that options trading inherently revolves around volatility speculation [^20]. A strong consensus has emerged in options markets concerning the expression of volatility, leading to prices often quoted in terms of bid-ask volatility spreads [^20]. Options data inherently captures the market consensus regarding future volatility, making option-based forecasts potentially superior to estimates solely reliant on historical information [^20].

Empirical evidence supports the notion that options data offers superior forecasts [^20]. The breakdown of the EMS in September 1992 proves useful for showing the usefulness of data. Comparative volatility forecasts for 1992, including estimates from DM/BP cross-options, RiskMetrics volatility, and a 60-day moving average were compared.

As heavy selling pressure by speculators mounted on the British pound, the ISD surged, forecasting a substantial exchange rate movement [^20]. The pound was removed from the EMS on September 16 [^20]. The RiskMetrics volatility responded post hoc, while the MA volatility lagged further. As such, options traders rationally priced turbulence before it occurred, making the ISD significantly more valuable than time-series-based models [^20]. The market had immediate access to the current information and rationally anticipated the move prior to its unfolding.

To quantify the potential for improving volatility forecasting by incorporating Implied Volatility (IV) with historical time series models, consider the following approach:

**Teorema 2 (Combined Forecast with IV and Time Series Models):** *A combined volatility forecast that optimally weights the implied volatility (IV) from options data and the forecast from a time series model (e.g., GARCH) can achieve lower forecast errors than either model alone.*

The combined forecast is given by:

$$\sigma_{combined}^2 = \omega_{IV} \sigma_{IV}^2 + (1 - \omega_{IV}) \sigma_{GARCH}^2$$

where:

*   $\sigma_{combined}^2$ is the combined volatility forecast.

*   $\sigma_{IV}^2$ is the implied volatility derived from options data.

*   $\sigma_{GARCH}^2$ is the volatility forecast from a GARCH model.

*   $\omega_{IV}$ is the weight assigned to implied volatility, which can be optimized to minimize the forecast error.

*Proof strategy:* The combination of forecasts aims to leverage the strengths of both implied volatility and time series models. Implied volatility captures market expectations, while time series models incorporate historical patterns. By optimally weighting these forecasts, one can reduce the overall forecast error. The optimal weight $\omega_{IV}$ is often determined by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) or another suitable loss function using historical data.

*Proof:*
I. Define the Combined Forecast:

*   The combined forecast is a weighted average of the implied volatility and the GARCH volatility forecast, as given by the formula:

$$\sigma_{combined}^2 = \omega_{IV} \sigma_{IV}^2 + (1 - \omega_{IV}) \sigma_{GARCH}^2$$

II. Define the Forecast Error:

*   The forecast error is the difference between the actual realized volatility ($\sigma_{realized}^2$) and the combined forecast ($\sigma_{combined}^2$). Let the forecast error be $e$:

$$e = \sigma_{realized}^2 - \sigma_{combined}^2$$

III. Define the Mean Squared Error (MSE):

*   The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the average of the squared forecast errors over a given period. It's a common metric used to evaluate the accuracy of forecasts. Given $T$ observations, the MSE is:

$$MSE = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} e_t^2 = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (\sigma_{realized, t}^2 - \sigma_{combined, t}^2)^2$$

IV. Optimize the Weight $\omega_{IV}$ to Minimize MSE:

*   To find the optimal weight $\omega_{IV}$ that minimizes the MSE, we differentiate the MSE with respect to $\omega_{IV}$ and set the derivative to zero:

$$\frac{d(MSE)}{d\omega_{IV}} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} 2(\sigma_{realized, t}^2 - \sigma_{combined, t}^2) \frac{d(-\sigma_{combined, t}^2)}{d\omega_{IV}} = 0$$

*   First, find $\frac{d(\sigma_{combined, t}^2)}{d\omega_{IV}}$:

$$\frac{d(\sigma_{combined, t}^2)}{d\omega_{IV}} = \frac{d}{d\omega_{IV}} [\omega_{IV} \sigma_{IV, t}^2 + (1 - \omega_{IV}) \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2] = \sigma_{IV, t}^2 - \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2$$

*   Substitute this back into the derivative of the MSE:

$$\frac{d(MSE)}{d\omega_{IV}} = \frac{2}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (\sigma_{realized, t}^2 - \sigma_{combined, t}^2) (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) = 0$$

V. Solve for $\omega_{IV}$:

*   Rearrange the equation to solve for $\omega_{IV}$:

$$\sum_{t=1}^{T} (\sigma_{realized, t}^2 - [\omega_{IV} \sigma_{IV, t}^2 + (1 - \omega_{IV}) \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2]) (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) = 0$$

$$\sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{realized, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) - \sum_{t=1}^{T} [\omega_{IV} \sigma_{IV, t}^2 + (1 - \omega_{IV}) \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2] (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) = 0$$

$$\sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{realized, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) - \omega_{IV} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{IV, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) - \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) + \omega_{IV} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) = 0$$

*   Collect terms involving $\omega_{IV}$:

$$\omega_{IV} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) - \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{IV, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) \right] = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) - \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{realized, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2)$$

$$\omega_{IV} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T} (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{realized, t}^2) (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2)}{\sum_{t=1}^{T} (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2)^2}$$

VI. Conclusion:

*   By using the optimal weight $\omega_{IV}$, the combined forecast minimizes the MSE and provides a more accurate estimate of future volatility compared to using either the implied volatility or the GARCH forecast alone. $\blacksquare$

> üí° **Exemplo Num√©rico:** Let's assume we have a GARCH(1,1) model and options data for a particular asset. We want to combine the volatility forecasts from these two sources. Suppose we have the following values:
>
> - $\sigma_{IV}^2 = 0.000144$ (Implied Volatility squared, corresponding to $\sigma_{IV} = 0.012$)
> - $\sigma_{GARCH}^2 = 0.0001$ (GARCH Volatility squared, corresponding to $\sigma_{GARCH} = 0.01$)
>
> To find the optimal weight $\omega_{IV}$, we need historical data on realized volatility. Let's assume we have 100 days of data, and through optimization (e.g., using numerical methods), we find that the optimal weight is $\omega_{IV} = 0.6$.
>
> Now we can calculate the combined volatility forecast:
>
> $\sigma_{combined}^2 = \omega_{IV} \sigma_{IV}^2 + (1 - \omega_{IV}) \sigma_{GARCH}^2$
> $\sigma_{combined}^2 = 0.6 \cdot 0.000144 + (1 - 0.6) \cdot 0.0001$
> $\sigma_{combined}^2 = 0.0000864 + 0.00004$
> $\sigma_{combined}^2 = 0.0001264$
>
> The combined volatility is:
> $\sigma_{combined} = \sqrt{0.0001264} \approx 0.01124$
>
>
> To validate if combining GARCH and IV reduces error, let's assume a realized volatility of 0.0115 and calculate the errors for each model and the combined model:
>
> $\text{Error}_{IV} = (0.0115 - 0.012)^2 = (-0.0005)^2 = 0.00000025$
> $\text{Error}_{GARCH} = (0.0115 - 0.01)^2 = (0.0015)^2 = 0.00000225$
> $\text{Error}_{Combined} = (0.0115 - 0.01124)^2 = (0.00026)^2 = 0.0000000676$
>
> In this simplified example, the combined forecast has a lower error than either the IV or GARCH forecast alone. This demonstrates the potential benefits of combining forecasts.

Despite these advantages, there are certain potential drawbacks to keep in mind:
a) Implied volatility has no guarantee for accuracy and may also subsume systematic biases due to risk premia [^20].
b) Implied volatility is more useful during chaotic scenarios when conditions change quickly, but is not necessarily more effective during steady-state, well-behaved periods.

**Teorema 2.1 (Optimal Weight Determination):** The optimal weight $\omega_{IV}$ in the combined forecast model described in Teorema 2 can be determined by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the combined forecast and the realized volatility over a historical period.

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is defined as:

$$MSE = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (\sigma_{realized, t}^2 - \sigma_{combined, t}^2)^2$$

where:

*   $\sigma_{realized, t}^2$ is the realized volatility at time t (e.g., calculated from high-frequency data).
*   $\sigma_{combined, t}^2$ is the combined volatility forecast at time t.
*   $T$ is the number of historical observations.

*Proof strategy:*
The optimal weight $\omega_{IV}$ is found by solving the following optimization problem:

$$\min_{\omega_{IV}} MSE(\omega_{IV})$$

This can be done using numerical optimization techniques. The realized volatility can be estimated using various methods, such as the sum of squared returns over a specific period (e.g., daily or weekly). By minimizing the MSE, we find the weight that gives the most accurate combined volatility forecast based on historical data.

The text concludes: Therefore, my advice is as follows: Whenever possible, VAR should use implied parameters [^20].

### Conclus√£o
In summary, forecasting risk and correlations plays a crucial role in managing Value at Risk (VaR). Although time series models can be created, there is no guarantee for future accuracy, and implied parameters are far more effective in real-time markets than simple moving averages [^20].

This risk measure, however, surely was not constant over time. In addition, time variation in risk could explain the fact that the empirical distribution of returns does not quite exactly fit a normal distribution. Figure 9-2 compares the normal approximation with the actual empirical distribution of the $/BP exchange rate. Relative to the normal model, the actual distribution contains more observations in the center and in the tails. These fat tails can be explained by two alternative viewpoints. The first view is that the true distribution is stationary and indeed contains fat tails, in which case a normal approximation is clearly inappropriate. The other view is that the distribution does change through time. As a result, in times of turbulence, a stationary model could view large observations as outliers when they are really drawn from a distribution with temporarily greater dispersion. In practice, both explanations carry some truth. This is why fore-casting variation in risk is particularly fruitful for risk management. In‚Äù*
[^19]: P√°gina 237: *‚ÄúMeasures of VAR are only as good as the quality of forecasts of risk and correlations. Historical data, however, may not provide the best available forecasts of future risks. Situations involving changes in regimes, for in-stance, are simply not reflected in recent historical data. This is why it is useful to turn to forecasts implied in options data. An important function of derivatives markets is price discovery. Derivatives provide information about market-clearing prices, which includes the discovery of volatility. Options are assets whose price is influenced by a number of factors, all of which are observable save for the volatility of the underlying price. By setting the market price of an option equal to its model value, one can recover an implied volatility, or implied standard deviation (ISD). Essentially, the method consists of inverting the option pricing formula, finding OiSD that equates the model price f to the market price, given current market data and option features, that is, Cmarket = f(OISD) (9.15) where f represents, for instance, the Black-Scholes function for European options. This approach can be used to infer a term structure of ISDs every day, plotting the ISD against the maturity of the associated option. Note that OISD corresponds to the average volatility over the life of the option instead of the instantaneous, overnight volatility. If quotes are available only for longer-term options, we will need to extrapolate the volatility surface to the near term. Implied correlations also can be recovered from triplets of options on the same three assets. Correlations are also implicit in so-called quanto options, which involve two random variables. An example of a quantity-adjusted option, for instance, would be an option struck on a foreign stock‚Äù*
[^20]: P√°gina 238: *‚ÄúIf options markets are efficient, the ISD should provide the market's best estimate of future volatility. After all, options trading involves taking volatility bets. Expressing a view on volatility has become so pervasive in the options markets that prices are often quoted in terms of bid-ask volatility. Since options reflect the market consensus about future volatil-ity, there are sound reasons to believe that options-based forecasts should be superior to historical estimates. The empirical evidence indeed points to the superiority of options data. An intuitive way to demonstrate the usefulness of options data is to analyze the September 1992 breakdown of the EMS. Figure 9-11 com-pares volatility forecasts during 1992, including that implied from DM/BP cross-options, the RiskMetrics volatility, and a moving average with a window of 60 days. As sterling came under heavy selling pressures by speculators, the ISD moved up sharply, anticipating a large jump in the exchange rate. Indeed, sterling went off the EMS on September 16. In contrast, the RiskMetrics volatility only moved up after the first big move, and the MA volatility changed ever so slowly. Since options traders rationally antici-pated greater turbulence, the implied volatility was much more useful than time-series models. Jorion (1995a), for instance, shows that for currency futures, options-implied volatilities subsume all information contained in time-series models. Campa and Chang (1998) find that the implied correlation for the dollar/mark and dollar/yen rates outperforms all historical models.‚Äù*

A desvantagem dos modelos hist√≥ricos, infelizmente, √© que eles est√£o sempre um passo atrasados, come√ßando a reagir *depois* que um grande movimento ocorreu [^1]. Para alguns prop√≥sitos, isso √© insuficiente, raz√£o pela qual as previs√µes de volatilidade idealmente devem usar informa√ß√µes nos valores das op√ß√µes, que s√£o prospectivas [^1].

Finalmente, deve-se notar que os modelos GARCH induzir√£o muito movimento nas previs√µes de VAR de 1 dia [^1]. Embora isso forne√ßa uma previs√£o mais precisa do risco para o dia seguinte, essa abordagem √© menos √∫til para definir limites de risco e encargos de capital [^1].

Assuma, por exemplo, que um *trader* tenha um limite de risco VAR baseado em um modelo GARCH de 1 dia e que a posi√ß√£o comece ligeiramente abaixo do limite VAR [^1]. Um grande movimento no fator de risco de mercado aumentar√° a volatilidade GARCH, aumentando assim o VAR da posi√ß√£o real que poderia bem exceder o limite VAR [^1]. Normalmente, a posi√ß√£o deve ser cortada para diminuir o VAR abaixo de seu limite [^1]. O *trader*, no entanto, protestar√° que a posi√ß√£o n√£o mudou e que esse pico de volatilidade √© tempor√°rio [^1].

Similarmente, o modelo VAR n√£o deve ser muito vol√°til se os encargos de capital forem baseados no VAR [^1]. Os encargos de capital devem absorver um grande choque ao longo de um horizonte longo [^1]. Usar uma volatilidade GARCH de 1 dia e a regra da raiz quadrada do tempo criar√° muita flutua√ß√£o no encargo de capital [^1]. Em tais situa√ß√µes, modelos de volatilidade de movimento lento s√£o mais apropriados [^1].

Modelos GARCH multivariados tamb√©m s√£o inadequados para problemas de gerenciamento de risco em larga escala, que envolvem um grande n√∫mero de fatores de risco [^1]. Isso ocorre porque existem simplesmente muitos par√¢metros para estimar, a menos que simplifica√ß√µes dr√°sticas sejam permitidas [^1]. Talvez isso explique por que, na pr√°tica, poucas institui√ß√µes usam tais modelos no n√≠vel mais alto de agrega√ß√£o [^1].

### Ap√™ndice 9.A: Modelos GARCH Multivariados

Os processos GARCH multivariados s√£o projetados para modelar a varia√ß√£o temporal na matriz de covari√¢ncia completa [^1]. A principal quest√£o √© que a dimensionalidade do modelo aumenta muito rapidamente com o n√∫mero de s√©ries $N$, a menos que simplifica√ß√µes sejam adotadas [^1]. Considere, por exemplo, um sistema de duas vari√°veis [^1]. A matriz de covari√¢ncia tem $M = N(N + 1)/2 = 3$ entradas [^1]. Esse n√∫mero cresce na velocidade de $N^2$ √† medida que $N$ aumenta [^1].

A primeira classe de modelos generaliza os modelos GARCH univariados [^1]. Isso leva ao modelo VEC(1,1), definido como:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} X_{1,t+1} \\ X_{2,t+1} \\ \vdots \\ X_{N,t+1} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \mu_1 \\ \mu_2 \\ \vdots \\ \mu_N \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,N} \\ a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,N} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{N,1} & a_{N,2} & \cdots & a_{N,N} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} X_{1,t} \\ X_{2,t} \\ \vdots \\ X_{N,t} \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} b_{1,1} & b_{1,2} & \cdots & b_{1,N} \\ b_{2,1} & b_{2,2} & \cdots & b_{2,N} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ b_{N,1} & b_{N,2} & \cdots & b_{N,N} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_{1,t} \\ \epsilon_{2,t} \\ \vdots \\ \epsilon_{N,t} \end{bmatrix}
$$

onde $\epsilon_t \sim N(0, \Sigma)$, e $\Sigma$ √© a matriz de covari√¢ncia. Este modelo tem muitos par√¢metros ($O(N^2)$), o que pode levar a problemas de superajuste com $N$ relativamente grande.

A segunda classe de modelos imp√µe estrutura em $\Sigma$ para reduzir o n√∫mero de par√¢metros. Um exemplo √© o modelo DCC (Dynamic Conditional Correlation), que assume que a correla√ß√£o condicional entre duas s√©ries temporais √© constante ao longo do tempo.

## Modelos de Difus√£o

Modelos de difus√£o s√£o uma classe de modelos generativos que aprendem a reverter um processo de difus√£o que destr√≥i iterativamente a estrutura nos dados por meio da adi√ß√£o gradual de ru√≠do [^2].

### Processo de Difus√£o Forward

O processo forward adiciona ru√≠do gaussiano aos dados iterativamente, transformando-os gradualmente em ru√≠do gaussiano puro.

$$
q(x_t | x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1 - \beta_t} x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
$$

onde $x_t$ √© a imagem ruidosa no passo de tempo $t$, $\beta_t$ √© o cronograma de vari√¢ncia, e $I$ √© a matriz identidade. O processo forward √© uma cadeia de Markov, significando que a distribui√ß√£o de probabilidade de $x_t$ depende somente de $x_{t-1}$.

Dado $x_0 \sim q(x)$, podemos perturbar iterativamente adicionando ru√≠do gaussiano por $T$ passos. Para $T$ suficientemente grande, $x_T$ √© essencialmente ru√≠do gaussiano isotr√≥pico.

Uma propriedade √∫til deste processo √© que podemos amostrar $x_t$ em qualquer timestep $t$ diretamente de $x_0$:

$$
q(x_t | x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0, (1 - \bar{\alpha}_t)I)
$$

onde $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$ e $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{i=1}^t \alpha_i$.

### Processo de Difus√£o Reverso

O objetivo do processo de difus√£o reverso √© aprender a reverter o processo forward, come√ßando com ru√≠do gaussiano puro $x_T$ e iterativamente de-ru√≠do para obter uma amostra do dados $x_0$.

Se $\beta_t$ √© suficientemente pequeno, o processo reverso tamb√©m √© gaussiano [^2]:

$$
p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t))
$$

onde $\mu_\theta(x_t, t)$ e $\Sigma_\theta(x_t, t)$ s√£o aprendidos.

Na pr√°tica, √© comum fixar a vari√¢ncia e apenas aprender a m√©dia [^2]:

$$
p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \sigma_t^2 I)
$$

onde $\sigma_t^2$ √© uma constante.

### Treinamento

Durante o treinamento, o modelo aprende a prever o ru√≠do adicionado em cada passo de tempo. A fun√ß√£o de perda √©:

$$
L = \mathbb{E}_{t \sim [1, T], x_0, \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)} \left[ || \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) ||^2 \right]
$$

onde $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)$ √© a previs√£o do modelo do ru√≠do adicionado em tempo $t$.

### Amostragem

Para gerar uma nova amostra, primeiro amostramos $x_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$, e ent√£o iterativamente de-ru√≠do usando o processo reverso aprendido.

$$
x_{t-1} = \mu_\theta(x_t, t) + \sigma_t z
$$

onde $z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$.
