### IntroduÃ§Ã£o

This chapter focuses on techniques for forecasting variations in risk and correlations within financial markets, building upon previous discussions regarding volatility models and correlation dynamics [^1]. As mentioned earlier [^1, 3], financial markets exhibit time-varying volatility, which necessitates the use of models capable of capturing these fluctuations for effective risk management. We previously explored methods for modeling such fluctuations in volatility including moving average techniques as well as GARCH and EWMA based techniques.

This section will explore how **price discovery** in derivatives markets, particularly options, provides valuable information about market prices, including volatility, and offers insights into the market's expectation of future volatility [^19].

In doing so, we can refine our risk management and decision-making capabilities beyond relying on solely historical data. **Implied Volatility (ISD)** emerges as a superior forward-looking measure derived from option prices, potentially outperforming traditional models by providing a more accurate estimation of future risk [^19].

### Conceitos Fundamentais

#### 9.4 Using Options Data

Measures like VaR are only as effective as the quality of risk and correlation forecasts they utilize; solely relying on historical data may not provide the best predictions for future risks [^19]. Historical data's inherent limitation lies in its delayed incorporation of regime shifts and market dynamics [^19]. If regulatory or market conditions undergo sudden changes, models based purely on historical data necessitate significant revisions, inducing lags in VaR quantification.

##### 9.4.1 Implied Volatilities

A pivotal function of derivative markets is **price discovery**, the process where markets disseminate information about market-clearing prices [^19]. Derivatives provide information about market clearing prices, including **volatility discovery**, which can often be difficult to model or obtain [^19]. Options, for instance, are assets whose prices depend on several factors, including the underlying asset's volatility [^19]. With all other factors observable, the volatility can be extracted by equating an option's market price with its theoretical (model) price [^19]. This process provides the **implied volatility**, also referred to as the **implied standard deviation (ISD)** [^19]. It represents the market's expectation of future volatility over the life of the option and can be seen as the market's risk-neutral expectation.

**Definition:** Implied volatility, denoted as $\sigma_{ISD}$, is the volatility value that, when input into an option pricing model (e.g. Black-Scholes), results in the model price matching the observed market price of the option.

**Teorema 1 (Inverting Option Pricing Models):** *The implied volatility can be obtained by inverting an option pricing formula. Find $\sigma_{ISD}$ such that:*

$$C_{market} = f(\sigma_{ISD})$$

*where $C_{market}$ is the market price of the option and $f$ is the option pricing function (e.g. Black-Scholes).*[^19] In practice, numerical methods must be employed to find $\sigma_{ISD}$ because $f$ is nonlinear and doesn't have an analytical inverse.

> ðŸ’¡ **Exemplo NumÃ©rico:** Consider a European call option on a stock. The current market price of the stock is $S_0 = \$100$, the strike price is $K = \$105$, the time to expiration is $T = 0.5$ years, the risk-free interest rate is $r = 5\%$ per annum, and the market price of the option is $C_{market} = \$6.50$. We want to find the implied volatility $\sigma_{ISD}$ using the Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes formula for a call option is:
>
> $C = S_0 N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2)$
>
> where:
>
> $d_1 = \frac{\ln(S_0/K) + (r + \sigma^2/2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}$
>
> $d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}$
>
> and $N(x)$ is the cumulative standard normal distribution function.
>
> We need to find the value of $\sigma_{ISD}$ that satisfies $C_{market} = C$. Since there is no direct analytical solution, we use numerical methods. Here, we will use the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of the function $g(\sigma) = C(\sigma) - C_{market}$.

>
> $d_2 = -0.1329 - 0.20 \sqrt{0.5} = -0.1329 - 0.1414 = -0.2743$
>
> $N(d_1) = N(-0.1329) \approx 0.4471$
>
> $N(d_2) = N(-0.2743) \approx 0.3920$
>
> $C(\sigma_0) = 100 \times 0.4471 - 105 \times e^{-0.05 \times 0.5} \times 0.3920 = 44.71 - 105 \times 0.9753 \times 0.3920 = 44.71 - 40.25 = 4.46$

> This example demonstrates how, given an option's market price and other parameters, we can iteratively solve for the implied volatility using the Newton-Raphson method with the Black-Scholes model. The result, 27.60%, represents the market's expectation of the stock's volatility over the option's remaining life.

*Proof (Sketch):* In a complete and arbitrage-free market, the price of an option is uniquely determined by its underlying asset price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free rate, and volatility. By observing the market price of an option and knowing all other inputs, we can solve for the implied volatility that satisfies the equation.

*Proof:*

I. Option Pricing Models:
*   Option pricing models, such as the Black-Scholes model, provide a theoretical value for an option based on several inputs, including the underlying asset price ($S_0$), strike price ($K$), time to maturity ($T$), risk-free interest rate ($r$), and volatility ($\sigma$).
*   The general form of an option pricing model can be represented as: $C = f(S_0, K, T, r, \sigma)$

where $C$ is the theoretical price of the option and $f$ is the option pricing function.
II. Market Price of the Option:
The market price of an option ($C_{market}$) is the price at which the option is trading in the market. This price reflects the collective expectations and risk preferences of market participants.

III. Implied Volatility (ISD):

*   The implied volatility is the value of $\sigma$ that equates the theoretical price of the option with its market price.
*   Mathematically, the implied volatility is the solution to the equation: $C_{market} = f(S_0, K, T, r, \sigma_{ISD})$

IV. Numerical Methods to find $\sigma_{ISD}$ :
Several numerical methods can be used, including Newton-Raphson and the bisection method.

This numerical method is essential for the practical extraction of market-implied volatility from option prices, given the non-linear nature of most option pricing models. $\blacksquare$

**Teorema 1.1 (Uniqueness of Implied Volatility):** Under certain conditions, for a given option pricing model and market price, the implied volatility is unique.

*Proof (Sketch):* The Black-Scholes formula (and similar option pricing models) are monotonically increasing functions of volatility. This implies that for a given set of parameters ($S_0, K, T, r$) and a specific market price $C_{market}$, there can be at most one value of $\sigma_{ISD}$ that satisfies the equation $C_{market} = f(S_0, K, T, r, \sigma_{ISD})$. However, this holds true provided the market price does not allow for arbitrage opportunities. If $C_{market}$ is outside the arbitrage bounds, the implied volatility may not exist or may not be unique.

These techniques allow us to derive a term structure of ISDs, providing insights into market expectations for volatility at various time horizons.

#### 9.4.2 ISDs as Risk Forecasts

If option markets are efficient, the ISD should provide the optimal forecast of future volatility [^20]. Options trading revolves around volatility speculation, with prices often quoted in bid-ask volatility spreads [^20]. This reflects a strong consensus in options markets concerning the expression of volatility, potentially making option-based forecasts superior to estimates solely reliant on historical information [^20]. As mentioned previously [^19] these models are also more useful and can capture market consensus regarding current volatilities.

> ðŸ’¡ **Exemplo NumÃ©rico:** A numerical example is useful to prove how options data may potentially have data sooner than simple moving averages. We should note again Jorion (1995a) for an instance of shows that for currency futures, options-implied volatilities subsume all information contained in time-series models [^20]. Campa and Chang (1998) find that the implied correlation for the dollar/mark and dollar/yen rates outperforms all historical models [^20]. Therefore, my advice is as follows: Whenever possible, VAR should use implied parameters [^20].
It is also useful to prove that by combining the forecasts from two sources we can get an even better and more accurate estimate for risk measurement. As we have established in this chapter: The historical data (Time Series Models, MA) captures the past trends, the implied volatility (Options Data) captures current market expectations, and the *Combined Forecast* reduces the overall forecast error. A way to establish this claim is to see the accuracy with which the model is able to forecast a specific metric.

In order to prove this, consider:

**Lemma 1 (Forecast Combination for Implied Volatility):** Combining implied volatility (IV) with historical volatility forecasts from GARCH models can improve forecasting performance, especially in periods of market turbulence.
>
> To quantify the potential for improving volatility forecasting by incorporating Implied Volatility (IV) with historical time series models, consider the following approach:

**Teorema 2 (Combined Forecast with IV and Time Series Models):** *A combined volatility forecast that optimally weights the implied volatility (IV) from options data and the forecast from a time series model (e.g. GARCH) can achieve lower forecast errors than either model alone.*

The combined forecast is given by:

$$\sigma_{combined}^2 = \omega_{IV} \sigma_{IV}^2 + (1 - \omega_{IV}) \sigma_{GARCH}^2$$

where:

*   $\sigma_{combined}^2$ is the combined volatility forecast.
*   $\sigma_{IV}^2$ is the implied volatility derived from options data.
*   $\sigma_{GARCH}^2$ is the volatility forecast from a GARCH model.
*   $\omega_{IV}$ is the weight assigned to implied volatility, which can be optimized to minimize the forecast error.
*Proval strategy:* The combination of forecasts aims to leverage the strengths of both implied volatility and time series models. Implied volatility captures market expectations, while time series models incorporate historical patterns. By optimally weighting these forecasts, one can reduce the overall forecast error. The optimal weight $\omega_{IV}$ is often determined by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) or another suitable loss function using historical data.
*Proof:*

I. Define the Combined Forecast:

*   The combined forecast is a weighted average of the implied volatility and the GARCH volatility forecast, as given by the formula:

$$\sigma_{combined}^2 = \omega_{IV} \sigma_{IV}^2 + (1 - \omega_{IV}) \sigma_{GARCH}^2$$

II. Define the Forecast Error:

*   The forecast error is the difference between the actual realized volatility ($\sigma_{realized}^2$) and the combined forecast ($\sigma_{combined}^2$). Let the forecast error be $e$:

$$e = \sigma_{realized}^2 - \sigma_{combined}^2$$

III. Define the Mean Squared Error (MSE):

*   The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is the average of the squared forecast errors over a given period. It's a common metric used to evaluate the accuracy of forecasts. Given $T$ observations, the MSE is:

$$MSE = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} e_t^2 = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (\sigma_{realized, t}^2 - \sigma_{combined, t}^2)^2$$

IV. Optimize the Weight $\omega_{IV}$ to Minimize MSE:

*   To find the optimal weight $\omega_{IV}$ that minimizes the MSE, we differentiate the MSE with respect to $\omega_{IV}$ and set the derivative to zero:

$$\frac{d(MSE)}{d\omega_{IV}} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} 2(\sigma_{realized, t}^2 - \sigma_{combined, t}^2) \frac{d(-\sigma_{combined, t}^2)}{d\omega_{IV}} = 0$$

*   First, find $\frac{d(\sigma_{combined, t}^2)}{d\omega_{IV}}$:

$$\frac{d(\sigma_{combined, t}^2)}{d\omega_{IV}} = \frac{d}{d\omega_{IV}} [\omega_{IV} \sigma_{IV, t}^2 + (1 - \omega_{IV}) \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2] = \sigma_{IV, t}^2 - \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2$$

*   Substitute this back into the derivative of the MSE:

$$\frac{d(MSE)}{d\omega_{IV}} = \frac{2}{T} \sum_{t=1}^{T} (\sigma_{realized, t}^2 - \sigma_{combined, t}^2) (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) = 0$$

V. Solve for $\omega_{IV}$:

*   Rearrange the equation to solve for $\omega_{IV}$:

$$\sum_{t=1}^{T} (\sigma_{realized, t}^2 - [\omega_{IV} \sigma_{IV, t}^2 + (1 - \omega_{IV}) \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2]) (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) = 0$$

$$\sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{realized, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) - \sum_{t=1}^{T} [\omega_{IV} \sigma_{IV, t}^2 + (1 - \omega_{IV}) \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2] (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) = 0$$

$$\sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{realized, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) - \omega_{IV} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{IV, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) - \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) + \omega_{IV} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) = 0$$

*   Collect terms involving $\omega_{IV}$:

$$\omega_{IV} \left[ \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) - \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{IV, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) \right] = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2) - \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sigma_{realized, t}^2 (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2)$$

$$\omega_{IV} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{T} (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{realized, t}^2) (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2)}{\sum_{t=1}^{T} (\sigma_{GARCH, t}^2 - \sigma_{IV, t}^2)^2}$$

VI. Conclusion:

*   By using the optimal weight $\omega_{IV}$, the combined forecast minimizes the MSE and provides a more accurate estimate of future volatility compared to using either the implied volatility or the GARCH forecast alone. $\blacksquare$

```

### Constructing the Volatility Surface

Using the interpolated volatilities across different strikes and maturities, a volatility surface can be constructed.  This surface is a 3D representation of volatility as a function of strike price and time to maturity.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Sample strike prices (replace with your actual strike prices)
strike_prices = np.array([90, 95, 100, 105, 110])

# Sample maturities (replace with your actual maturities)
maturities = np.array([0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0])

# Sample volatility data (replace with your interpolated volatilities)
volatilities = np.array([
    [0.12, 0.13, 0.14, 0.15, 0.16],  # Maturity 0.25
    [0.15, 0.16, 0.17, 0.18, 0.19],  # Maturity 0.5
    [0.18, 0.19, 0.20, 0.21, 0.22],  # Maturity 0.75
    [0.21, 0.22, 0.23, 0.24, 0.25]   # Maturity 1.0
])

# Create a meshgrid for the strike prices and maturities
strike_grid, maturity_grid = np.meshgrid(strike_prices, maturities)

# Create a 3D plot
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

# Plot the volatility surface
surf = ax.plot_surface(strike_grid, maturity_grid, volatilities, cmap='viridis')

# Set the axis labels
ax.set_xlabel('Strike Price')
ax.set_ylabel('Maturity')
ax.set_zlabel('Volatility')

# Set the title of the plot
ax.set_title('Volatility Surface')

# Add a color bar
fig.colorbar(surf)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Data Preparation**: Example strike prices, maturities, and interpolated volatilities are defined.  These should be replaced with your actual data.
2.  **Meshgrid Creation**:  `np.meshgrid` creates a rectangular grid from the strike prices and maturities.  This grid is used to plot the surface.
3.  **3D Plot Creation**:  A 3D plot is created using `matplotlib`.
4.  **Surface Plotting**:  `ax.plot_surface` plots the volatility surface.  `cmap='viridis'` specifies the color map used to represent the volatility values.
5.  **Axis Labels and Title**:  The axis labels and title are set to provide context to the plot.
6.  **Color Bar**:  A color bar is added to show the mapping between volatility values and colors.
7.  **Plot Display**:  `plt.show()` displays the plot.

This code provides a basic framework for constructing and visualizing a volatility surface. Adjust the strike prices, maturities, and volatility data to match your specific dataset.  The color map can also be changed to suit your preferences.

### Calibrating Option Pricing Models

The implied volatility surface can be used to calibrate parameters of option pricing models, such as the Heston model or the SABR model.  Calibration involves finding the model parameters that best fit the observed market prices (or, equivalently, implied volatilities).

**Example: Calibration using `scipy.optimize`**

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize
from scipy.stats import norm

# Black-Scholes Model
def black_scholes(S, K, T, r, sigma, option_type='call'):
    """
    Calculates the Black-Scholes option price.

    Args:
        S: Current stock price
        K: Strike price
        T: Time to maturity (in years)
        r: Risk-free interest rate
        sigma: Volatility
        option_type: 'call' or 'put'

    Returns:
        Option price
    """
    d1 = (np.log(S / K) + (r + 0.5 * sigma ** 2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
    d2 = d1 - sigma * np.sqrt(T)

    if option_type == 'call':
        price = S * norm.cdf(d1) - K * np.exp(-r * T) * norm.cdf(d2)
    elif option_type == 'put':
        price = K * np.exp(-r * T) * norm.cdf(-d2) - S * norm.cdf(-d1)
    else:
        raise ValueError("option_type must be 'call' or 'put'")

    return price

# Define the objective function to minimize (e.g., sum of squared errors)
def objective_function(sigma, S, K, T, r, market_price, option_type='call'):
    """
    Calculates the sum of squared errors between the Black-Scholes price and the market price.

    Args:
        sigma: Volatility (parameter to calibrate)
        S: Current stock price
        K: Strike price
        T: Time to maturity (in years)
        r: Risk-free interest rate
        market_price: Observed market price of the option
        option_type: 'call' or 'put'

    Returns:
        Sum of squared errors
    """
    model_price = black_scholes(S, K, T, r, sigma, option_type)
    error = (model_price - market_price)**2
    return error

# Example usage
S = 100      # Current stock price
K = 100      # Strike price
T = 1        # Time to maturity
r = 0.05     # Risk-free rate
market_price = 10 # Market price of the option (call)

# Initial guess for volatility
initial_sigma = 0.2

# Minimize the objective function
result = minimize(objective_function, initial_sigma, args=(S, K, T, r, market_price),
                    method='Nelder-Mead')

# Extract the calibrated volatility
calibrated_sigma = result.x[0]

print("Calibrated Volatility:", calibrated_sigma)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Black-Scholes Model**: A function to calculate the Black-Scholes option price.
2.  **Objective Function**: An objective function is defined to measure the difference between the model price (calculated using the Black-Scholes formula) and the market price.  The goal is to minimize this difference. The Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) is a common choice for the objective function.
3.  **Minimization**: The `scipy.optimize.minimize` function is used to find the volatility (`sigma`) that minimizes the objective function.
    *   `initial_sigma`: An initial guess for the volatility is provided.  The choice of initial guess can affect the speed and convergence of the optimization.
    *   `args`:  The arguments to the objective function (other than the parameter being calibrated) are passed as a tuple.
    *   `method`: The optimization method used by `minimize`.  `Nelder-Mead` is a robust method that doesn't require derivatives.
4.  **Calibrated Volatility**: The optimized volatility is extracted from the `result` object.

This example demonstrates how to calibrate the volatility parameter in the Black-Scholes model.  For more complex models like Heston or SABR, the objective function and the calibration process would be more involved, typically requiring specialized libraries or custom implementations. These models require simultaneous calibration of multiple parameters.

### Using the Calibrated Parameters for Option Pricing

Once the model is calibrated, the calibrated parameters can be used to price other options with different strikes and maturities.

```python
# Example using the calibrated volatility to price a different option

S = 100          # Current stock price
K_new = 105      # New strike price
T_new = 0.5        # New time to maturity
r = 0.05         # Risk-free rate

# Use the calibrated volatility
option_price_new = black_scholes(S, K_new, T_new, r, calibrated_sigma, option_type='call')

print("Price of the new option:", option_price_new)
```

This code demonstrates how to use the calibrated volatility (`calibrated_sigma`) obtained in the previous step to price a new call option with strike price `K_new` and time to maturity `T_new`. The Black-Scholes model, along with the calibrated volatility, provides an estimate of the fair price of this new option. Keep in mind that the accuracy of this price depends on the quality of the calibration and the validity of the model assumptions.
