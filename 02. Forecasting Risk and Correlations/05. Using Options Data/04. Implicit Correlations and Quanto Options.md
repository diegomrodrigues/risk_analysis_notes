### Introdução

This chapter explores techniques for predicting risk variation and correlations, with a special focus on the use of options data. As we have seen previously, the volatility of the financial market is predictable and has important implications for risk management, including Value at Risk (VAR) [^1]. Traditionally, time series models have been used to capture temporal variation in volatility [^2]. In addition to the term structure of implied volatility, implicit correlations can be derived from *triplets* of options on the same three assets and are implicit in *quanto* options [^19]. This section will explore how options data and implied correlations can be used to enhance risk forecasts, with analysis of the September 1992 European Monetary System (EMS) breakdown case [^20].

To further motivate the use of options data, consider that they reflect the market's aggregate view on future uncertainty, incorporating expectations and risk premia that are often absent from historical data. As a result, implied volatility and correlation measures tend to be more reactive to impending market shocks.

### Deriving Implicit Correlations

In addition to individual volatilities, implicit correlations can also be recovered from *triplets* of options on the same three assets [^19]. Correlations are also implicit in so-called *quanto* options, which involve two random variables. An example of a *quantity-adjusted* option, for example, would be an option launched on a foreign stock indexed where the payment in foreign currency is translated into dollars at a fixed rate [^19, 20]. The valuation formula for such an option also involves the correlation between two sources of risk. Thus, options can potentially reveal a wealth of information about future risks and correlations [^19].

Before delving into the specifics of *quanto* options, it is instructive to consider the limitations and assumptions inherent in extracting implicit correlations, as highlighted below.

**Lema 1 (Assumptions for Implicit Correlation):** The accuracy of implicit correlation estimates derived from options data relies heavily on the validity of the option pricing model used, the liquidity of the options market, and the absence of significant arbitrage opportunities.

*Proof:*
I. **Model Dependency:** The Black-Scholes model, commonly used for extracting implied volatilities, assumes that the underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant volatility. If this assumption is violated, the implied volatility and subsequent correlation estimates will be biased. More sophisticated models may mitigate this, but introduce their own sets of assumptions.

II. **Market Liquidity:** Illiquid options markets can lead to stale prices and large bid-ask spreads, making the derived implicit correlations unreliable. Trading activity and market depth are crucial for obtaining meaningful estimates.

III. **Arbitrage-Free Pricing:** The absence of arbitrage opportunities is a fundamental assumption in option pricing theory. If arbitrage opportunities exist and are not rapidly exploited, option prices may deviate from their theoretical values, leading to inaccurate implied correlations. ■

For a deeper analysis, consider the following theorem that expands on **Proposition 1** presented earlier:

**Theorem 3 (Implicit Correlation with Different Types of Options):** The formula for the implicit correlation can be derived for different combinations of call and put options on the individual assets and on the portfolio.

*Proof*: Let's consider the case where we have a call option on asset 1, a put option on asset 2, and a call option on portfolio P. The variances of the individual assets and the portfolio are obtained from the option prices using the Black-Scholes model, and the implicit correlation is calculated as described in **Proposition 1**[^19].

1.  **Call Option on Asset 1 and Put Option on Asset 2**: Let $C_1$ be the price of the call option on Asset 1 and $P_2$ be the price of the put option on Asset 2. Using the Black-Scholes model, we extract the implicit volatilities $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ from the prices of these options, according to **Theorem 1**[^19].
2.  **Option on Portfolio**: Consider a portfolio $P$ consisting of assets 1 and 2 with weights $w_1$ and $w_2$, respectively. We obtain an option on this portfolio and extract the portfolio's implied volatility $\sigma_P$.
3.  **Implicit Correlation**: The portfolio variance is given by:
    $$\sigma_P^2 = w_1^2 \sigma_1^2 + w_2^2 \sigma_2^2 + 2 w_1 w_2 \rho_{12} \sigma_1 \sigma_2$$
    Rearranging, we can solve for the implicit correlation $\rho_{12}$ as:
    $$\rho_{12} = \frac{\sigma_P^2 - w_1^2 \sigma_1^2 - w_2^2 \sigma_2^2}{2 w_1 w_2 \sigma_1 \sigma_2}$$
    This formula is general and holds regardless of the types of options (call or put) used for the individual assets, as long as the option on the portfolio is compatible with the options of the individual assets.

> 💡 **Numerical Example:** Calculating Implicit Correlation
>
> Consider two assets, Asset 1 and Asset 2, forming a portfolio. We have the following information:
>
> *   Weight of Asset 1 in the portfolio, $w_1 = 0.6$
> *   Weight of Asset 2 in the portfolio, $w_2 = 0.4$
> *   Implied volatility of Asset 1, $\sigma_1 = 0.20$ (20%)
> *   Implied volatility of Asset 2, $\sigma_2 = 0.30$ (30%)
> *   Implied volatility of the Portfolio, $\sigma_P = 0.25$ (25%)
>
> Using the formula:
> $$\rho_{12} = \frac{\sigma_P^2 - w_1^2 \sigma_1^2 - w_2^2 \sigma_2^2}{2 w_1 w_2 \sigma_1 \sigma_2}$$
>
> We can calculate the implicit correlation $\rho_{12}$:
>
> $$\rho_{12} = \frac{(0.25)^2 - (0.6)^2 (0.20)^2 - (0.4)^2 (0.30)^2}{2 \cdot 0.6 \cdot 0.4 \cdot 0.20 \cdot 0.30}$$
>
> $$\rho_{12} = \frac{0.0625 - 0.0144 - 0.0144}{0.0288}$$
>
> $$\rho_{12} = \frac{0.0337}{0.0288} \approx 1.17$$
>
> Note that the correlation $\rho_{12}$ exceeding 1 suggests potential issues such as model misspecification or data errors. In real scenarios, correlations must lie between -1 and 1. This example highlights the importance of verifying input data and assumptions when deriving implicit correlations.

**Corollary 3.1:** Let $\rho_{12}$ be the implicit correlation calculated using call options on asset 1, put options on asset 2, and a call option on portfolio P, and let $\rho_{12}'$ be the implicit correlation calculated using put options on asset 1, call options on asset 2, and a put option on portfolio P. Then, in efficient markets, $\rho_{12}$ should be approximately equal to $\rho_{12}'$.

*Proof:*
I. Let $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ be the volatilities of assets 1 and 2, and $\sigma_P$ be the volatility of the portfolio $P$. The implicit correlation $\rho_{12}$ is derived from call options on asset 1, put options on asset 2, and a call option on portfolio $P$. Similarly, $\rho_{12}'$ is derived from put options on asset 1, call options on asset 2, and a put option on portfolio $P$.

II. Assuming efficient markets, the price of a call option and its corresponding put option (with the same strike price and expiration date) should satisfy the put-call parity. Put-call parity ensures that the relationship between call and put option prices is consistent and that no arbitrage opportunities exist.
    $$C - P = S - Ke^{-rT}$$
    where $C$ is the call price, $P$ is the put price, $S$ is the spot price of the asset, $K$ is the strike price, $r$ is the risk-free interest rate, and $T$ is the time to maturity.

III. Since the portfolio $P$ consists of assets 1 and 2, and efficient markets ensure that put-call parity holds for both individual assets and the portfolio, any differences in the implied volatilities extracted from call and put options should be minimal. This is because any deviation from put-call parity would be quickly exploited by arbitrageurs.

IV. Therefore, if the implied volatilities $\sigma_1$, $\sigma_2$, and $\sigma_P$ are consistent across different combinations of call and put options (due to put-call parity), the calculated implicit correlations $\rho_{12}$ and $\rho_{12}'$ should be approximately equal. This is because the formula for implicit correlation depends on these implied volatilities and the portfolio weights, which remain constant regardless of whether call or put options are used.

V. Consequently, in efficient markets, $\rho_{12} \approx \rho_{12}'$. ■

> 💡 **Numerical Example:** Verifying Corollary 3.1 with Put-Call Parity
>
> Suppose:
> *   Spot price of Asset 1, $S_1 = 100$
> *   Spot price of Asset 2, $S_2 = 50$
> *   Strike price for both assets, $K = 100$ and $K = 50$, respectively
> *   Risk-free interest rate, $r = 0.05$
> *   Time to maturity, $T = 1$ year
> *   Call option price on Asset 1, $C_1 = 10$
> *   Put option price on Asset 1, $P_1 = 4.87$ (calculated using put-call parity: $P_1 = C_1 - S_1 + Ke^{-rT} = 10 - 100 + 100e^{-0.05} \approx 4.87$)
> *   Call option price on Asset 2, $C_2 = 5$
> *   Put option price on Asset 2, $P_2 = 2.56$ (calculated using put-call parity: $P_2 = C_2 - S_2 + Ke^{-rT} = 5 - 50 + 50e^{-0.05} \approx 2.56$)
> *   Implied volatility of Asset 1 using $C_1$, $\sigma_1 = 0.2$
> *   Implied volatility of Asset 2 using $C_2$, $\sigma_2 = 0.3$
> *   Portfolio weights: $w_1 = 0.6$, $w_2 = 0.4$
> *   Implied portfolio volatility, calculated using options on portfolio, $\sigma_P = 0.25$
>
> Using call options on Asset 1 and Asset 2 to calculate $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$, respectively, combined with portfolio options, we get $\rho_{12} \approx 1.17$ (as in the previous example).
>
> Now, we use put options on Asset 1 and Asset 2, using the same $\sigma_P$, $w_1$, and $w_2$. The resulting $\rho_{12}'$ should be approximately equal to $\rho_{12}$ (ideally, identical in a perfect market with accurate put-call parity). Any minor differences would reflect market imperfections or rounding errors, but in efficient markets, they should be very close.

**Lema 3.1** (Impact of Moneyness): The moneyness of the options used to derive implicit correlations can influence the resulting estimate. Out-of-the-money options are more sensitive to tail risk and may yield different correlation estimates compared to at-the-money options.

This proof demonstrates that the implicit correlation can be consistently estimated using different combinations of call and put options. By applying this theorem, *traders* and risk analysts can derive implicit correlations from a variety of options instruments. This theorem provides a theoretical basis for consistently estimating the implicit correlation using various types of options, increasing the flexibility and applicability of implicit correlation estimation techniques. This is crucial when dealing with incomplete market data, in which certain types of options may not be readily available [^19].

Furthermore, we can examine the estimation of volatility and correlation for *quanto* options.

**Theorem 4 (Implicit Volatility and Correlation in *Quanto* Options):** In a *quanto* option, which involves converting a payment in foreign currency to a domestic currency at a fixed rate, the valuation formula includes both the volatility of the foreign asset and the correlation between the foreign asset and the exchange rate.

*Proof*: The valuation of a *quanto* option requires consideration of the joint dynamics of the foreign asset price and the exchange rate between the foreign currency and the *domestic* currency. Let's denote the price of the foreign asset in foreign currency as $S_f$ and the exchange rate as $X$ (units of the *domestic* currency per unit of the foreign currency). The option payment is converted to the *domestic* currency at a fixed exchange rate $X_0$.

1.  **Asset Dynamics**: We assume that $S_f$ and $X$ follow log-normal processes with volatilities $\sigma_f$ and $\sigma_X$, respectively, and correlation $\rho$ between their returns.
2.  **Price of the *Quanto* Option**: The price of a *quanto* option can be derived under the *risk-neutral* framework, taking into account the correlation between the asset price and the exchange rate. The general formula for the price of a *quanto* call option is:
    $$C = e^{-rT} \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}[(S_f X_0 - K)^+]$$
    where $r$ is the *domestic* interest rate, $T$ is the time to maturity, $K$ is the strike price in *domestic* currency, and $\mathbb{Q}$ denotes the *risk-neutral* measure.
3.  **Implicit Volatility and Correlation**: The valuation of this expectation requires knowledge of $\sigma_f$, $\sigma_X$ and $\rho$. In markets where *quanto* options are actively traded, we can reverse the observed *quanto* option price to solve for an implicit volatility or implicit correlation, assuming the other parameters are known.

    *   **Implicit Volatility**: If the correlation $\rho$ is known (for example, from historical data), we can solve for an implicit volatility that balances the model price with the market price of the *quanto* option.
    *   **Implicit Correlation**: Conversely, if the volatilities $\sigma_f$ and $\sigma_X$ are known (for example, from standard options on the foreign asset and the exchange rate), we can solve for an implicit correlation that balances the model price with the market price of the *quanto* option.

**Corollary 4.1:** Given the complexity of the *quanto* option pricing formula, extracting implicit correlations requires numerical methods. However, the sensitivity of the *quanto* option price to the implicit correlation critically depends on the option parameters and the volatilities of the underlying assets.

**Proposição 1 (Impact of Correlation on Quanto Option Prices):** An increase in the correlation between the foreign asset and the exchange rate can either increase or decrease the *quanto* option price depending on the relative magnitudes of the volatilities and the moneyness of the option.

*Proof:*
I.  **Quanto Option Price**: The price of a *quanto* option depends on the correlation $\rho$ between the foreign asset and the exchange rate.

II. **Formula Analysis**: Consider the *quanto* option pricing formula:
    $$C = e^{-rT} \mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}[(S_f X_0 - K)^+]$$
    where $C$ is the price of the call option, $r$ is the risk-free interest rate, $T$ is the time to maturity, $K$ is the strike price, $S_f$ is the price of the foreign asset, and $X_0$ is the fixed exchange rate. The expectation $\mathbb{E}^{\mathbb{Q}}$ depends on the volatilities $\sigma_f$ and $\sigma_X$ and the correlation $\rho$.

III. **Impact of Correlation**:
    *   **Low Exchange Rate Volatility**: If $\sigma_X < \sigma_f$, a higher positive $\rho$ typically increases the option price. This is because a higher correlation implies that the foreign asset and the exchange rate tend to move in the same direction. If the foreign asset increases in value, and the exchange rate does not decrease too much (due to low $\sigma_X$), the *quanto* option is more likely to be in the money.
    *   **High Exchange Rate Volatility**: If $\sigma_X > \sigma_f$, a higher positive $\rho$ may decrease the option price. In this scenario, the exchange rate's movements dominate the *quanto* option's behavior. A high correlation means that the foreign asset and the exchange rate move together, but if the exchange rate's volatility is high, the uncertainty in the final payment increases, which can reduce the option price.

IV. **Conclusion**: The effect of the correlation on the *quanto* option price depends on the relative magnitudes of $\sigma_f$ and $\sigma_X$ and the moneyness of the option. Therefore, an increase in correlation can either increase or decrease the *quanto* option price. ■

> 💡 **Numerical Example:** *Quanto* Option in the Brazilian Market
>
> Consider a *quanto* option on Petrobras (PETR4) shares traded on the B3 (Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão) and with payment in dollars at a fixed exchange rate. The data are:
>
> *   Spot price of PETR4 (in BRL): R\$ 30.00

>
> To find the implicit correlation, we need to use iterative methods. Using the *quanto* option pricing model, we vary the correlation until the model price matches the market price (\$ 1.50). In this example, we assume the implicit correlation is 0.6. We can iterate over different values for $\rho$ to converge to a solution that prices the *quanto* option correctly.

### Analysis of the EMS Breakdown in September 1992

The analysis of the EMS breakdown in September 1992 demonstrates the usefulness of options data [^20]. Figure 9-11 compares volatility forecasts during 1992, including those implicit in DM/BP *cross-options*, RiskMetrics volatility, and a moving average with a 60-day window [^20].
![Comparison of Volatility Forecasts During the EMS Breakdown](./../images/volatility_forecasts_ems_breakdown.jpg)
As the pound sterling came under heavy selling pressure from speculators, the ISD rose sharply, anticipating a major jump in the exchange rate. In fact, the pound sterling left the EMS on September 16 [^20]. In contrast, RiskMetrics volatility only rose *after* the first major move, and MA volatility changed very slowly [^20]. As *options traders* rationally anticipated greater turbulence, implicit volatility was much more useful than time-series models [^20].

**Teorema 5 (Early Warning Signal):** The rate of change of implicit correlation can act as an early warning signal for impending market turbulence, often preceding large price movements and changes in realized volatility.

*Proof:* The implicit correlation derived from options reflects market expectations of joint movements between assets. When market participants anticipate increased systemic risk or contagion, they adjust their expectations, which are reflected in options prices. A rapid increase in implicit correlation indicates heightened awareness of potential co-movements and can foreshadow periods of instability.

I. **Market Expectation**: Implicit correlation captures market expectations of how assets will move together.
II. **Systemic Risk**: Increased systemic risk or contagion fears lead market participants to expect stronger co-movements between assets.
III. **Option Prices**: This expectation adjustment gets reflected in options prices, causing a change in implicit correlation.
IV. **Early Warning**: A rapid increase in implicit correlation signals heightened awareness of potential co-movements, acting as an early warning for market instability.

Therefore, the rate of change of implicit correlation can serve as an early warning signal. ■

> 💡 **Numerical Example:** Impact of the EMS Breakdown on Implicit Correlation
>
> Suppose that before the EMS breakdown, the implicit correlation between the pound sterling (GBP) and the German mark (DEM) was 0.8. As pressure on the pound sterling increased, option prices reflected uncertainty about the pound's ability to remain within the EMS bands. The implicit correlation between GBP and DEM derived from *quanto* options rose to 0.95, reflecting the expectation that both currencies would be increasingly linked to central bank intervention or a joint movement. Models based on historical data may not capture this increase in correlation, making implicit correlations more valuable.
>
> To illustrate this further, assume the daily change in correlation is monitored:
> *   Day 1: $\rho_{GBP, DEM} = 0.80$
> *   Day 2: $\rho_{GBP, DEM} = 0.82$
> *   Day 3: $\rho_{GBP, DEM} = 0.85$
> *   Day 4: $\rho_{GBP, DEM} = 0.90$
> *   Day 5: $\rho_{GBP, DEM} = 0.95$
>
> The change in correlation from Day 1 to Day 5 is 0.15, or 15 percentage points. The daily changes are:
> *   Day 2: 0.02
> *   Day 3: 0.03
> *   Day 4: 0.05
> *   Day 5: 0.05
>
> A significant jump in the daily change, especially on Days 4 and 5, would signal increasing market stress and potential for large movements, acting as an early warning signal. Time-series models might only reflect this increased volatility *after* the event, while option-implied correlations reflect anticipatory behavior.

### Conclusão

In conclusion, options data, particularly implied volatilities and correlations, provide valuable *forward-looking* information for risk management [^20]. *Theorem 3* extends the previous Proposition 1 and allows a more flexible estimation of the implicit correlation, incorporating different types of options, while *Theorem 4* provides a framework for the analysis of *quanto* options. The EMS breakdown in 1992 illustrates the importance of implicit correlations in detecting market movements in a timely manner. By incorporating option-derived information into VAR models, risk analysts can improve their ability to capture market behavior, especially in times of turbulence [^21]. However, it is important to consider the limitations of option-derived data, such as risk-neutral biases and limited data availability [^20]. A strategic combination of historical data and *forward-looking* information can provide a more comprehensive risk assessment.
