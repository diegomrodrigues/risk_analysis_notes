        "Delta-normal methods use delta or linear exposures with covariance matrices. Historical simulation is easier to implement among full valuation models. Monte Carlo simulation is the most complete but most difficult to implement model.",
        "In practice, all VAR methods are used. Banks initially used delta-normal for simplicity. Many institutions now use historical simulation over 1-4 years, supplemented by stress testing to minimize risk management blind spots.",
        "Monte Carlo, theoretically, alleviates many difficulties and can incorporate non-linear positions, non-normal distributions, and user-defined scenarios. However, it demands significant computer and data resources, introduces model risk, and can reduce VAR's intuitive appeal.",
        "Methods for measuring VAR divide into local and full valuation, reflecting a trade-off between computational speed and evaluation accuracy. Delta-normal is computationally efficient, fast, and accurate, less prone to model risk, and easily explainable. Historical simulation is relatively easy to compute and implement, using full valuation, but depends on a narrow window and creates substantial VAR number inaccuracy."
